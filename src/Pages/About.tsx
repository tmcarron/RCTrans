      <p>
        Since 1975, RC Trans and Gear has been commited to our customer's needs.
        Started by Randy Carron, now owned by Mike Carron. We are known for our
        quality work and we show our confidence in that with our long warranty.
        Mike's 3 sons also work at the shop, hoping to turn Randy's wish of a
        3rd generation company into a reality.
